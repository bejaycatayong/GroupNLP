The dataset was uploaded and loaded into a pandas DataFrame, then using VADER sentiment analyzer for sentiment scoring. The dataset then was converted into Huggingface's Dataset format for preparation for machine learning training pipelines, which was split into training and evaluation subsets, ready for fine-tuing models like BERT."
